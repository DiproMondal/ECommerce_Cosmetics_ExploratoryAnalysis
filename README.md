- Numpy
- Seaborn (for visualization)
- Plotly (for visualization)

**About dataset**

The dataset contains behavior data lying within 5 months (Oct 2019 â€“ Feb 2020) from a medium cosmetics online store.
In the dataset, each row represents an event. All events are related to products and users. Each event is like many-to-many relation between products and users.

We make an exploratory analysis of the data based on the following viewpoints:
- User activity 
- Product range
- Price
- Event types
- Event time
- Brands
